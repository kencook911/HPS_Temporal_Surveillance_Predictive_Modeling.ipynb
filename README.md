Time-Series Forecasting of Anxiety and Depression Trends in Perinatal-Relevant Populations (2020–2025)

                                                              Project Description
This project analyses longitudinal trends in anxiety and depression reporting using biweekly survey data from the U.S. Household Pulse Survey (2020–2024). Due to the absence of accessible UK-based longitudinal perinatal mental health datasets, women of childbearing age (18–49 years) were used as a proxy population for perinatal mental health research.

The study applies advanced time-series modelling, forecasting, and unsupervised clustering to examine how mental health prevalence evolved during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and to project short-term trends into 2025. The project also translates statistical outputs into an interactive Power BI dashboard to support public health surveillance and service planning.
